# Fast API LMS

This repo goes along with the video on the Faraday Academy YouTube channel: https://youtu.be/gQTRsZpR7Gw

You can follow along with the video.  

This repo is my code as I followed along with the tutorial.  I'm doing this because I intend to use FastAPI for another project and I wanted to run through a tutorial that helps me understand it better before getting started with my personal project.
