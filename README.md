## Overview & Requirements

This is a learning management system where teachers can manage student and students can see their courses.

- Teachers can perform CRUD operations on students.
- Teachers can create courses with sections and content blocks in each section.
- Teachers can assign courses to students.
- Students can interact view their courses in a list.
- Students can see the sections and content blocks for individual courses that they are taking.
- Students are able to see their progress for each course.

## Running the App Locally

1. Make sure Python, Poetry, and Postgres are installed. Postgres must be running. *If you need help with this, please follow the instructions in the video linked at the top of this README.*
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3. Install packages: `poetry install`
4. Run the development server: `uvicorn main:app --reload`

## Tech Stack
